    <h1>The Giving Tree</h1>

    <p>
        <em>The Giving Tree</em> is written by Shel Silverstein. Its a story about a tree 
        and a kid that grow up together. The tree loves the boy and 
        gives him everything she has throughout his life. As the boy grows 
        older, he keeps coming back to the tree whenever he needs something. 
        The tree gives him her apples, her branches, and eventually her trunk 
        so he can be happy. In the end, all she has left is a stump, but she 
        is still happy to give the boy a place to sit and rest. The story 
        teaches lessons about love, generosity, and selflessness.
